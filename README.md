## About This Project
This website tracks the predictions made in Dario Amodei's essay ["Machines of Loving Grace: How AI Could Transform the World for the Better"](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) (October 2024). The essay outlines an optimistic vision for how artificial intelligence could dramatically improve human life across multiple domains within 5-10 years after the development of powerful AI.

## Purpose
Our goal is to create a living document that tracks progress toward these predictions in real-time. This helps:
- Provide transparency around AI development and its impacts
- Enable community discussion about progress and setbacks
- Create accountability for these optimistic predictions
- Foster hope and track positive developments in AI

## Key Prediction Categories
The tracker monitors predictions across four main categories:

1. **Biology and Physical Health**
   - Prevention of infectious diseases
   - Cancer treatment advances
   - Genetic disease solutions
   - Alzheimer's prevention
   - Biological freedom
   - Lifespan extension

2. **Neuroscience and Mental Health**
   - Mental illness treatment
   - Solutions for structural conditions
   - Genetic prevention of mental illness
   - Everyday cognitive enhancement

3. **Economic Development and Poverty**
   - Global health distribution
   - Economic growth in developing world
   - Food security
   - Climate change solutions

4. **Peace and Governance**
   - Democratic advantages in AI
   - Free information environment
   - Legal system improvements
   - Government service enhancement
