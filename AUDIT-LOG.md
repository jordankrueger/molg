# MOLG Audit Log

Automated weekly evaluation of AI progress predictions.
Each entry shows what was scanned, what changed, and why.

## 2026-02-26

**Articles scanned:** 155 | **Overall progress:** 18.4%

**Changes:**
- **Cancer Treatment** (biology): 20% → 22% — Article describes engineers developing bacteria that invade and consume tumors from inside, representing concrete progress in novel cancer treatment approaches
- **Alzheimer's Prevention** (neuroscience): 15% → 17% — Article reports discovery of early noninvasive diagnostic markers (brain blood flow and oxygen use changes) that could enable earlier detection and intervention for Alzheimer's disease risk

**Summary:** This week's news coverage focused heavily on FDA regulatory issues, drug development challenges, and various scientific discoveries. For Amodei's predictions, most articles were either tangential or represented foundational progress rather than near-term breakthroughs. However, two articles showed concrete scientific advances: bacteria engineered to consume tumors from within represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment, and the discovery of early biomarkers for Alzheimer's (brain blood flow changes detectable via noninvasive scanning) represents meaningful progress toward prevention and early intervention. Most other articles—covering FDA rejections, vaccine debates, drug pricing, and regulatory reform—reflect systemic healthcare challenges rather than AI-driven breakthroughs. The regulatory environment actually appears somewhat more restrictive (FDA mixed signals, prior authorization debates, Medicaid funding pauses), which could hinder the rapid translation of AI advances into clinical practice, though this doesn't directly negate the underlying scientific progress.
