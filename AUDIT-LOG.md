# MOLG Audit Log

Automated weekly evaluation of AI progress predictions.
Each entry shows what was scanned, what changed, and why.

## 2026-03-02

**Articles scanned:** 156 | **Overall progress:** 18.7%

**Changes:**
- **Alzheimer's Prevention** (biology): 15% → 17% — Rice University scientists created the first full molecular atlas of an Alzheimer's brain using AI and laser imaging, revealing previously unknown chemical changes beyond amyloid plaques. This represents concrete progress in understanding Alzheimer's pathology at a molecular level, though still far from prevention/treatment.
- **Infectious Disease Prevention** (biology): 35% → 36% — Denmark became the first EU country to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, representing concrete progress on infectious disease prevention at the population level. WHO certification validates this achievement.
- **Infectious Disease Prevention** (biology): 36% → 37% — Libya eliminated trachoma as a public health problem, achieving WHO validation. This is the second concrete elimination of an infectious disease in this news cycle, demonstrating measurable progress toward the prediction of reliable prevention/treatment of natural infectious diseases.

**Summary:** This week's review focused on recent health, science, and technology news from late February 2026. Most articles were either tangential to the core predictions (pharmaceutical pricing disputes, device launches, basic science discoveries) or represented early-stage research without yet-demonstrated impact. However, three articles warranted small progress increases: Denmark's elimination of mother-to-child HIV and syphilis transmission and Libya's elimination of trachoma both represent concrete achievements in infectious disease prevention at the population level, earning +1 each. Additionally, Rice University's AI-driven molecular mapping of Alzheimer's brain pathology represents meaningful progress in understanding disease mechanisms necessary for prevention (+1). These represent genuine, WHO-validated achievements rather than speculative announcements. No other predictions showed clear evidence of meaningful progress in this news cycle.

## 2026-02-26

**Articles scanned:** 155 | **Overall progress:** 18.4%

**Changes:**
- **Cancer Treatment** (biology): 20% → 22% — Article describes engineers developing bacteria that invade and consume tumors from inside, representing concrete progress in novel cancer treatment approaches
- **Alzheimer's Prevention** (neuroscience): 15% → 17% — Article reports discovery of early noninvasive diagnostic markers (brain blood flow and oxygen use changes) that could enable earlier detection and intervention for Alzheimer's disease risk

**Summary:** This week's news coverage focused heavily on FDA regulatory issues, drug development challenges, and various scientific discoveries. For Amodei's predictions, most articles were either tangential or represented foundational progress rather than near-term breakthroughs. However, two articles showed concrete scientific advances: bacteria engineered to consume tumors from within represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment, and the discovery of early biomarkers for Alzheimer's (brain blood flow changes detectable via noninvasive scanning) represents meaningful progress toward prevention and early intervention. Most other articles—covering FDA rejections, vaccine debates, drug pricing, and regulatory reform—reflect systemic healthcare challenges rather than AI-driven breakthroughs. The regulatory environment actually appears somewhat more restrictive (FDA mixed signals, prior authorization debates, Medicaid funding pauses), which could hinder the rapid translation of AI advances into clinical practice, though this doesn't directly negate the underlying scientific progress.
